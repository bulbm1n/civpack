# CivPack

CivPack is a careful list of mods aimed to give you best experience playing on Civ servers with a civ ruleset. The pack is specifically designed around [CivMC](https://civmc.net/) (play.civmc.net), but should work with similar server. It is a mix of pvp mods, performance mods and general tools that are useful when playing civ. It includes CombatRadar and CivModern which are specifically made for civ along with more common plugins like JourneyMap and Litematica to for QOL. It should also outperform a regular minecraft install, but if any mods are causing issues of course disable them. This pack will be updated as Minecraft updates and new versions of mods are released (especially JSMacros when it updates). The pack is just meant to work for Civ and improve any player's experience without compromising performance. 

If you encounter any issues please reach out for support in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FbksW3BfbS) and someone will gladly help. Any and all feedback is welcome!

This modpack was design for play.civmc.net, if you'd like to find out more head over to the [CivMC Discord](https://discord.gg/civmc)
